# Florida Vanity Plate Availability Checker

This is a project to check the availability of short license plate letter and number combinations in Florida using the Florida DMV website. I threw this project together in one night so it is a little rough around the edges. 



# Setup

### Install dependencies:
run ` pip install selenium
 `

# Configuration
edit ` config.py ` with your prefered options

# Usage
run `generator.py`

After some time available plates will be listed in ` works.json `
